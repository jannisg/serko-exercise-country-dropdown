# Serko Exercise: Country Dropdown

**Welcome to this exercise repository.**

The intention for this exercise is to understand a bit more about how you work as a frontend focussed engineer.

We have designed this exercise to take approximately 2 hours of your time.
If the exercise is not completed in full, feel free to add some notes as a markdown file explaining why and how you would have continued with more time.

## Where to start
Please head over to read the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md), please also note the [context](CONTEXT.md) file we have provided for your notes.

## How to get running

### Prerequisites
- Node LTS, we have tested this exercise using version 18.x

### Running code
In order to save time with project setup, we have created a minimal sandbox environment using Vite. This should allow you to jump straight into solving the problem and not need to spend time setting up the basic tools and dev server.

1. `npm install` to install the dependencies required
2. `npm run dev` to launch the Vite powered dev server for local development

MSW has been pre-configured with the appropriate mock data to simulate an API. You can see the result in your browser's console once the dev server is running. 

Types for this mock API have been provided in the `src/types/api.d.ts` file. The `src/utils` folder contains a basic fetch function for demonstration purposes. You are welcome to use these utility functions or create your own.
